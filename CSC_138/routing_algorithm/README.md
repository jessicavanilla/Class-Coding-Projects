# Task Overview
In this lab, you will be working with the Bellman-Ford algorithm, a robust method for finding
the shortest path in graphs that may contain edges with negative weights. Unlike algorithms
such as Dijkstra's, which only work with non-negative edge paths, Bellman-Ford can handle
negative edge weights, making it versatile for a wider range of applications. This property is
particularly useful in various network scenarios, such as dealing with changing routing costs
or potentially malicious routing behaviors.
