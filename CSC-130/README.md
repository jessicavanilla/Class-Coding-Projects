CSC 130: Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis


## Final project specifications:

CSC 130 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis Final Project 250 Points

Complete a single screen game “level” using Data Structures / Algorithms

The purpose of this project is to test that you can apply the knowledge learned in this course while actually coding something interesting in Java. You will 
be using the Gaming API I gave you (which you used to complete the Checkpoint assignments). Follow the steps / specifications below for credit.

## Specifications
This project has two “layers” of requirements: one is algorithms and the other is data structures. Each has point value in your final grade on this project.

## Algorithms
Your project must DO the following (behavior, algorithms):

- Be a single screen “game” level (no scrolling)
- Have a character that moves in all four(4) directions (up, down, left, right)
- Character must have animation equal to that in Checkpoint #3 for EACH direction!
- The edges of the screen must be wall images that visually contain the “room”
- These images must have bounding box collision detection to prevent the player from walking through them
- There must be at least two (2) items inside of the “level” that can be examined when nearby and facing the object. Examining is done by looking at the item nearby and pressing the space bar
- Your program must display a description of the item examined when a user inspects it
- Your program must be free of errors, crashes, or warnings for credit

## Data Structures
Your project must fulfill the minimum Data Structure requirements:

Use at least one of the following Java Collections: ArrayList, Stack, or Queue for image data
Create a custom data type for the bounding box collision object (single bounding box with behavior)
Have a container that holds a collection of bounding boxes neatly
